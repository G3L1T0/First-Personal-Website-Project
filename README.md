This is my first personal project!
While this small, yet humble website was a required assignment/project there were some additions that I made that were not part of the assignment:
- > tags that I used that were not part of assignment - h2, b, p, ol, li 

At the moment I am unsure (and trying to figure out) how to use Github to turn this very small project into a viewable website that doesn't require the viewer to inconviently download everything.
In the meantime you can look through the contents of these files!
