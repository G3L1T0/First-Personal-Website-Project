   <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
   <p>Hello everyone! My name is Angel Delgado and I 
   grew up in a small country area around Lyons, Georgia. 
   My current major is Information Technology - Cybersecurity, and I am very 
   interested in becoming an ethical hacker! I am currently located in the Statesboro campus, 
   despite me still taking this class online. As far as my future career plans go I am still kind 
   of unsure because I highly doubt graduating and using the Cybersecurity degree to get a job will be easy. 
   Which brings me to the next point, I don't have any research experience but I do have work experience, 
   I am currently working in the Dining Commons here on the Statesboro campus, 
   but I am applying to other places that will help me learn any IT stuff. This is so that I can get use to being in the IT "field" 
   and I can use that on my resume so that I have a higher chance of being accepted when I do apply for a job that needs 
   an ethical hacker.</p> 

	<p>Currently my hobbies are playing card games with my friends as well as learning more on how to use Kali Linux by playing this website game, OverTheWire: Bandit.</p>

	<p>5 Interesting Things About Me:
	<ol>
		<li>Despite me not doing them anymore, I know how to do card tricks and I use to do them a lot back when I was in high school to help me become more "social".</li>
		<li>I really love investing, the idea of making more money is really appealing to me.</li>
		<li>I am a really fast typer! I type at 95 WPM, however I have an accuracy of about 80%, meaning I make a ton of mistakes!</li>
		<li>Often times, I am just funny when I don't want to be, and I am really unfunny when I try to be.</li>
		<li>I really love One Piece!</li>
